# Web Application with Node.js, Express, React, and Material-UI

This is a web application project that showcases the integration of a Node.js and Express backend with a React frontend. It allows you to fetch and display data from a public API using Axios and create a user-friendly interface with Material-UI.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for building robust and scalable server applications.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Material-UI**: A popular UI framework for creating modern and responsive user interfaces.

## Features

- **Backend (Node.js and Express)**:
  - Sets up a Node.js server using Express.js.
  - Defines routes for fetching data from a public API.
  - Implements error handling for API requests and responses.
  - Parses and formats the API data before sending it to the frontend.

- **Frontend (React.js)**:
  - Creates a React.js application that communicates with the Node.js backend.
  - Implements a user interface to display data retrieved from the API.
  - Utilizes React components and state management to update the UI when new data is fetched.
  - Includes error handling for any issues that may occur during data retrieval.
  - Provides a clean and user-friendly design using Material-UI.

- **Optional Features** (Choose at least one):
  - Implements client-side filtering or sorting options for the displayed data.
  - Adds pagination to display a limited number of items per page.
  - Implements a search feature to allow users to search for specific data within the results.
  - Includes unit tests for the React components or Node.js server using testing libraries like Jest or Mocha/Chai.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
Install dependencies:

sh
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
cd ../backend
npm install
Start the server and the React app in separate terminal windows:

sh
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
sh
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

Evaluation Criteria
Candidates will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Proper API integration and data retrieval.
Effective error handling for API requests and responses.
Quality of the React.js frontend, including user interface design and responsiveness.
Implementation of optional features (if chosen).
Code organization, readability, and documentation.
Submission and repository organization.
Bonus points for unit testing (if implemented).
Feel free to customize this project based on your specific needs and the level of expertise you are looking for in candidates. Ensure that your code is well-documented and follows best practices for Node.js and React.js development.
